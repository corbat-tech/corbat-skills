# fork-project.sh - Create an isolated copy of the current project
# =============================================================================
# Usage: fork-project.sh <feature-name> [project-dir]
#
# Creates a fully isolated git clone of the project for parallel development.
# The copy has its own .git directory, so agents cannot interfere with each other.
#
# Arguments:
#   feature-name  Name for the feature/copy (e.g., "auth-refactor")
#   project-dir   Project directory to fork (default: current directory)
#
# Output:
#   Creates ../projectName_copy_<feature-name>/ with:
#   - Full git clone (isolated .git)
#   - Branch work/<feature-name> checked out
#   - Dependencies installed
