# Changelog Format Guide

This guide follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Section order

Always use this order for change categories:

1. **Added** - New features
2. **Changed** - Changes in existing functionality
3. **Improved** - Enhancements to existing features (performance, UX, etc.)
4. **Fixed** - Bug fixes
5. **Removed** - Removed features
6. **Documentation** - Documentation-only changes
7. **Security** - Security-related changes

Only include sections that have entries. Do not add empty sections.

## Writing style

- Start each entry with a bold summary: `- **Short description**`
- Add sub-bullets for details if needed (indented with 2 spaces)
- Write from the user's perspective, not the developer's
- Use present tense: "Add", "Fix", "Improve" (not "Added", "Fixed")
- Group related changes under a single entry with sub-bullets

## Example

```markdown
## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-18

  - Multiple inputs can be processed simultaneously without blocking
  - Auto-classification of input types (command, query, code)

### Improved

  - 40% faster token rendering with batched updates
  - Reduced memory allocation during long responses

### Fixed

```
